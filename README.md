# COVID-FACT
<h4>A Fully-Automated Capsule Network-based Framework for Identification of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT scans</h4>

COVID-FACT proposes a two-stage fully-automated CT-scan based framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases. COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection in the fisrt stage, and passes the detected slices of each patient to the second stage to perform the patient-level classification.

COVID-FACT is fed with the segmented lung area as the input. In other words, instead of using an original chest CT image, first a <a href="https://github.com/JoHof/lungmask"> U-Net based segmentation model</a> is applied to extract the lung region, which is then provided as input to the COVID-FACT. Besides segmenting the lung regions, all images are normalized between 0 and 1, and resized from the original size of [512,512] to [256,256].

<b>The detailed COVID-Facts's structure and methodology is explained in detail at</b> https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.16041 .

<h3>Note : Please donâ€™t use COVID-FACT as the self-diagnostic model without performing a clinical study and consulting with a medical specialist.</h3>
COVID-FACT is not a replacement for clinical diagnostic tests and should not be used as a self-diagnosis tool to look for COVID-19 features without a clinical study at this stage. Our team is working on enhancing the performance and generalizing the model on multi-center datasets upon receiving more data from medical collaborators and scientific community. You can track new results and versions as they will be updated on this page.<br>

A sample of lung areas contibuting the most to the final output in COVID-FACT are shown usign the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1610.02391">GRAD-CAM</a> algorithm in the following image.

## Dataset
The publically available <a href="https://github.com/ShahinSHH/COVID-CT-MD">COVID-CT-MD dataset</a> is used to train/test the model.
This dataset contains volumetric chest CT scans of 171 patients positive for COVID-19 infection, 60 patients with CAP (Community Acquired Pneumonia), and 76 normal patients. Slice-Level labels (slices with the evidence of infection) are provided in this dataset.

For the detail description of the COVID-CT-MD dataset, please refer to the <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14623">https://arxiv.org/abs/2009.14623</a>.

## Lung Segmentation
The lungmask module for the lung segmentation is adopted from <a href="https://github.com/JoHof/lungmask">here</a> and can be installed using the following line of code:
```
pip install git+https://github.com/JoHof/lungmask
```
Make sure to have torch installed in your system. Otherwise you can't use the lungmask module.

## Code
The code for the Capsule Network implementation is adopted from <a href="https://keras.io/examples/cifar10_cnn_capsule/">here.</a>
The brief desciption of the code's functionality is as follows:
* The code aims to test a CT scan using the COVID-FACT model.
* The training code is not provided. However, the code to implement each stage of the model is available in the code
* The outcome is in the binary (COVID-19, non-COVID) format.
* The test data should be in the DICOM format, and all DICOM files corresponding to a CT scan should be located in one folder.

Codes are available as the following list:

* COVID-FACT_binary_test.py : Codes for testing a CT scan series <b>(Set the "data_path" at the very begining of the code based on your data directoy.)</b>
* weights-stage1-final-91.h5 : Best model's weight for the first stage
* weights-stage2-final-99.h5 : Best model's weight for the second stage

## Requirements
* Tested with (tensorflow-gpu 2 and keras-gpu 2.2.4) , and (tensorflow 1.14.0 and keras 2.2.4)<br>
-- Try tensorflow.keras instead of keras if it doesn't work in your system.
* Python 3.6
* PyTorch 1.4.0
