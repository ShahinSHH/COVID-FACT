# COVID-FACT
A Fully-Automated Capsule Network-based Framework for Identification of COVID-19 Cases from Chest CT scans

COVID-FACT proposes a two-stage fully-automated CT-scan based framework for identification of COVID-19 positive cases. COVID-FACT utilizes Capsule Networks, as its main building blocks and is, therefore, capable of capturing spatial information. In particular, to make the proposed COVID-FACT independent from sophisticated segmentations of the area of infection, slices demonstrating infection are detected
at the first stage and the second stage is responsible for classifying patients into COVID and non-COVID cases. COVID-FACT detects slices with infection, and identifies positive COVID-19 cases using an in-house CT scan dataset, containing COVID-19, community acquired pneumonia, and normal cases.
